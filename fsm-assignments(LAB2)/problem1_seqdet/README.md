Sequence detector FSM (Mealy machine) for detecting the sequence '1101' with overlap in a given input datastream

Input sequences tested: Input sequence is given via din by clock cycle

Sequence 1: '1101'
Output: output(y) pulse at index '3'

Sequence 2: '11011010'
Output: output(y) pulse at indices '3' and '6'

To view the output waveforms, run the .vcd file using gtk wave via the terminal using the command: gtkwave <file_name>.vcd
